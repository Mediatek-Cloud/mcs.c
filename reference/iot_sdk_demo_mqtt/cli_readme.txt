        <port>: 0: STA;    1: AP
        Get the pin code of a specific wireless port, the pin code may be different for each function call.
        For AP interface, each time we will get the same PIN code, because the PIN is generated when AP interface initialized.
        For STA interface, each time we will get a dynamic PIN code.
        Example:
        wifi wps get pin_code 0 : Get 8-digital PIN code of STA.
        wifi wps get pin_code 1 : Get 8-digital PIN code of AP.

      - wifi wps trigger pbc <port> <BSSID>
        <port>:  0: STA;    1: AP
        <BSSID>: any: no special AP BSSID;   xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx :48 bit AP BSSID address.
        Example:
        For STA
            wifi wps trigger pbc 0 any :  trigger STA WPS PBC with any triggered WPS PBC AP.
            wifi wps trigger pbc 0 01:02:03:04:05:06 :  STA WPS PBC with BSSID=01:02:03:04:05:06 WPS PBC AP.
        For AP
            wifi wps trigger pbc 1 any : trigger AP WPS PBC. AP will ignor BSSID, so please only input "any".

      - wifi wps trigger pin <port> <BSSID> <PIN code>
        <port>:     0: STA;    1: AP
        <BSSID>:    any: no special AP BSSID;   xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx :48 bit AP BSSID address.
        <PIN code>: PIN code. Support both Static PIN code and Dynamic PIN code input. Dynamic PIN code is generated by cli "wifi wps get pin_code" or auto generate when the input PIN code is NULL.
        Example:
        For STA
            wifi wps trigger pin 0 any : Input PIN code is NULL, we will auto generate a 8-digital PIN and print. STA do WPS PIN with any triggered WPS PIN AP.
            In AP side, we need input the auto generated PIN code to it.

            wifi wps trigger pin 0 any  XXXXXXXX: "XXXXXXXX" instead a 8-digital PIN code got from CLI "wifi wps get pin_code", STA do WPS PIN with any triggered WPS PIN AP.
            In AP side, we need input "XXXXXXXX" PIN code to it.

            wifi wps trigger pin 0 xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx XXXXXXXX: STA do WPS PIN use "XXXXXXXX" PIN code with BSSID="xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" AP.
        For AP
            wifi wps trigger pin 1 any XXXXXXXX: AP will ignor BSSID, so please only input "any".
            AP do WPS PIN with the STA's PIN code="XXXXXXXX".

   - 'smart' commands
      - This command configures the device without input interface to connect to the wireless network.
        When using this command, users should also start the Smart Connection APP "Elian".
        The Smart Connection then broadcasts the encrypted wireless network information (SSID and Password of the AP router),
        the device will listen and decode the information to connect to the specified wireless network.
        User can get the Elian android APK under the path of MT7687 <sdk_root>\tools\elian, where the Smart Connection libraries for
        both Andriod and iOS are also included.
      - smart connect
        Start Smart Connection.

      - smart stop
        Stop Smart Connection.

   - 'ping' commands

      - ping <addr> <count> <pkt_len>


   - 'iperf' commands

      - iperf 2.x protocol is implemented.
      - iperf [-h]

      - iperf [-s|-c] [options]

        Client/Server:
          -u,    use UDP rather than TCP.
          -p,    #    server port to listen on/connect to (default 5001).
          -n,    #[kmKM]    number of bytes to transmit.
          -b,    #[kmKM]    for UDP, bandwidth to send at in bits/sec.
          -i,    10 seconds between periodic bandwidth reports.

        Server specific:
          -s,    run in server mode.
          -B,    <ip>    bind to <ip>, and join to a multicast group (only supports UDP).
          -r,    for UDP, run iperf in tradeoff testing mode, connecting back to client.

        Client specific:
          -c,    <ip>    run in client mode, connecting to <ip>.
          -w,    #[kmKM]    TCP window size.
          -l,    #[kmKM]    UDP datagram size.
          -t,    #    time in seconds to transmit for (default 10 secs).
          -S,    #    the type-of-service of outgoing packets.

        Miscellaneous:
          -h,    print this message and quit.

        [kmKM] Indicates options that support a k/K or m/M suffix for kilo- or mega-.

        TOS options for -S parameter:
        BE: -S 0
        BK: -S 32
        VI: -S 160
        VO: -S 224

        Tradeoff Testing Mode:
        Command: iperf -s -u -n <bits/bytes> -r

        Example:
        Iperf TCP Server: iperf -s
        Iperf UDP Server: iperf -s -u
        Iperf TCP Client: iperf -c <ip> -w <window size> -t <duration> -p <port>
        Iperf UDP Client: iperf -c <ip> -u -l <datagram size> -t <duration> -p <port>
