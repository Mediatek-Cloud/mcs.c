@par Run the examples
  - Below are two examples to demonstrate the Wi-Fi station and Wi-Fi access
    point modes of the LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Example 1. Wi-Fi station mode.
    - Find your Wi-Fi access point settings: Before connecting to a Wi-Fi
      access point, the following information needs to be collected:
      - The SSID of your Wi-Fi access point.
      - The password of your Wi-Fi access point.
    - Apply the following settings in the main.c source file to initialize
      the HDK. In this example the access point SSID is 'myhome' (length 6)
      and the password is '12345678' (length 8).
      - User-defined settings.
        \code
        wifi_config_t config = {0};
        config.opmode = WIFI_MODE_STA_ONLY;
        strcpy((char *)config.sta_config.ssid, "myhome");
        config.sta_config.ssid_length = strlen("myhome");
        strcpy((char *)config.sta_config.password, "12345678");
        config.sta_config.password_length = strlen("12345678");
        \endcode
      - Wi-Fi initialization.
        \code
        wifi_init(&config, NULL);
        \endcode
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt7687_hdk
    iot_sdk_demo" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to
    the LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Connect your board to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Reboot the HDK, the console will show "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate the HDK is booting up. If everything is correct, similar
    messages "DHCP got IP:10.10.10.101" will be shown in the console to
    notify your HDK has received an IP address.
    - PING from the LinkIt 7687 HDK. If the IP address is fetched and the
      network is operating, the LinkIt 7687 HDK can ping other
      devices/computer on the network with the following command in the
      console. ping 10.10.10.254 3 64 The ping stops after sending three
      packets to 10.10.10.254. The ping usage is: ping <ip_address>
      <ping_count> <ping_packet_length>.
  - Example 2. Wi-Fi access point mode.
    - Apply the Wi-Fi access point settings before proceeding:
      - SSID
      - Authentication Mode
      - Encryption Type
      - Password
      - Channel
    - Once the information is collected, use the following commands to
      configure the LinkIt 7687 HDK. The example code in main.c assumes WPA2
      PSK is used for authentication, AES for encryption, 'iot_ap' (length 6)
      for the SSID, the password of WPA2 as '87654321' (length 8) and the
      channel 6 is assigned to the channel.
      - User-defined settings.
        \code
        wifi_config_t config = {0};
        wifi_config.opmode = WIFI_MODE_AP_ONLY;
        strcpy((char *)wifi_config.ap_config.ssid, "iot_ap");
        wifi_config.ap_config.ssid_length = strlen("iot_ap");
        wifi_config.ap_config.auth_mode = WIFI_AUTH_MODE_WPA2_PSK;
        wifi_config.ap_config.encrypt_type = WIFI_ENCRYPT_TYPE_AES_ENABLED;
        strcpy((char *)wifi_config.ap_config.password, "87654321");
        wifi_config.ap_config.password_length = strlen("87654321");
        wifi_config.ap_config.channel = 6;
        \endcode
      - Wi-Fi initialization.
        \code
        wifi_init(&config, NULL);
        \endcode
  - Build the example project with the command "./build.sh mt7687_hdk
    iot_sdk_demo" from the SDK root folder and download the binary file to
    the LinkIt 7687 HDK.
  - Connect your board to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Reboot the HDK, the console will show "FreeRTOS Running" message to
    indicate the HDK is booting up.
    - Use a handheld device or a laptop computer to connect to the access
      point 'iot_ap'. On the HDK console, the IP address assigned to the
      handheld device or laptop is: [DHCPD:DBG]lease_ip:10.10.10.2
